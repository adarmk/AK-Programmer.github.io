        <p>Platitudes get a bad rap, often seen as being of little substance. But I think some of these ostensibly trite statements contain time-tested knowledge that is currently under-appreciated in our world, judging by how many people actually seem to live by them. Here are some of my favourite.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two wrongs don't make a right.</li>
<li>Treat others the way you want to be treated.</li>
<li>What goes around comes around.</li>
<li>The road to hell is paved with good intentions.</li>
<li>Rome wasn't built in a day.</li>
<li>Things could be worse.</li>
<li>You'll get over it.</li>
<li>You still have your health (unless you don't). </li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, none of these platitudes are always strictly true, but it's probably still a good idea to live by them in most aspects of your life.</p>
