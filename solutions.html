    <h1>Solutions</h1>
    <p>A log of solutions to textbook problems. 
        <br><br>
        In accordance with the now almost-cliché aphorism, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough," I use this log to 
        force me to explain my solutions better, so that I can solidify my understanding of concepts instead of just applying them. I also use it
        to keep me humble. I'm already looking back at my older proofs/solutions and cringing at how bad and inelegant they are!
